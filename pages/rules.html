      <h4 class="encabezado separacion">FIFA rules shall govern NYSL play except as modified herein.</h4>
      <div>
        <h3>SPORTSMANSHIP</h3>
        <ul class="mover_der mover_abajo">
          <li>
            The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire
            youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, 
            coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts
            from this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical soccer
            background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>FIFA FIELD REGULATIONS</h3>
        <ol class="mover_der mover_abajo">
          <li><strong>DIMENSIONS. </strong>FIFA Law 1 provides for flexible external 
          field dimensions within a given maximum and minimum width and length. 
          These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 
          12 and older.
          </li>
          <li><strong>COMPETITION FIELDS. </strong>Fields used within the competition 
            program must be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or 
            associations participating in the state competition program that are 
            unable to provide a field that meets these minimum requirements must 
            advise the State Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee 
            to inspect the field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of 
            the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts 
            or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be 
            required to play all their games away.
          </li>
          <li><strong>FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS</strong>
            <ol class="mover_der" type="a">
              <li>U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty areas.
                Fields for older age groups should be progressively larger.</li>
              <li>U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width.</li>
              <li>U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in width.</li>
              <li>In addition, fields used by young age groups may have their internal
                dimensions and size of goal similarly modified.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>ALL-PLAY</h3>
        <ul class="mover_der mover_abajo">
          <li>All-play means that every recreation player on every team shall play atleast 
            fifty percent of each game. Coaches in the competition program are encouraged 
            to play their players 50% of each game.
            <ul class="mover_der">
              <li>A Coach shall be permitted to not play a player 50% of each game under 
                special circumstances, e.g., unexcused absences from practice and/or games, 
                ungentlemanly conduct at practice and/or games, and injuries.
